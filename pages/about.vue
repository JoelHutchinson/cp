        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-3">
          <li>
            Go to the <strong>Puzzle Sets</strong> page and click
            <em>Create Puzzle Set</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select how many puzzles you want in the set, and choose an average
            difficulty rating that suits your current skill level.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optionally, filter by <strong>themes</strong> such as mating
            patterns, endgame types, or tactical motifs to focus your training.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once your set is created, start solving! The app records your
            results as you go.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each time you complete all the puzzles in a set, it counts as one
            <strong>cycle</strong>. The app tracks your progress through each
            cycle and calculates your accuracy.

            The <strong>Woodpecker Method</strong> is a structured chess
            training system developed by Grandmasters Axel Smith and Hans
            Tikkanen, first introduced in their book The Woodpecker Method
            (Quality Chess, 2018). The method focuses on systematic repetition
            of tactical exercises to dramatically enhance a player's tactical
            awareness, calculation speed, and pattern recognition — foundational
            skills for competitive success. The approach was inspired by
            Tikkanen’s personal training regimen, which helped him achieve three
            GM norms in a short span. The method works on the principle that
            repetition solidifies learning, especially when spaced repetition is
            combined with focused effort.
